# machineLearning-NCEA-Level2
Proposal:
Create a program to establish defined rules and positive/negative cues to allow a reinforcement algorithm to systematically teach itself to play a simple computer game; such as: Snake, Tetris, Connect 4, Pacman, Pong etc.

Purpose:
To prove my ability to create a finished programming outcome using modern machine learning technologies and create a firm knowledge base for future projects.

End Users:
The end users of the programming outcome will be those that have an interest in AI and machine learning technologies. It will allow them to see the learning process for a complete beginner to someone who has a semi-sufficient level of understanding.

Scope:
I will begin by following guides by programmers with more experience using ML technologies. Following this, once I feel as though I am able to implement my own version of these guides I will attempt to do so.

The time should take approximately 1 term to complete all of my practice/learning as well as the implementation.

The demonstration will showcase a fully featured game - seeing as the game itself is not part of the implementation of ML, I will likely use more guides to help me speed up this process. 
It will also show the AI attempting each game, this will add a visual element to the final product and allow other watchers to see the progress that the computer makes. 
The product will also likely display the current reward values.

The demo will not include sound or fancy graphics elements, the time that would be spent towards these elements will be better used at creating and refining the AI. They are also not key to the function or purpose of the project.

Requirements & Specifications
The program will feature a game which has all core functionality as the original.
The core functionality will be present and easily identifiable to anybody who looks at it running.
Fancy graphics elements will be used if required but kept to a minimum as they likely will not impact the functionality of the game.
The program will be made in python.
The library used for game creation will be pygame.
There are multiple python libraries for ML, I will likely use PyTorch or TensorFlow.
The program will be centred around ML.
I will ensure the game is completed with the computer actually learning rather than programming a step by step solution.
I will do this using reinforcement learning, where points are awarded to the computer depending on progress made. These determine the importance of each factor in the next generation.


Resources:
This project should take up to 12 weeks however I am hoping to finish it closer to 9

The project will not require specialist equipment, it will all be done using a code editor on my laptop

Use guides and tutorials online, potentially I will follow a slightly longer course in order to gain a more solid understanding - if necessary.

I will need to have a decent understanding of the python language in order to gain the rest of the necessary skills. This is a learning experience thus anything I donâ€™t know currently I will have to learn over the course of the project.
